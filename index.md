# Competitions Awards
### Dream Cup National Undergraduate Intelligent Hardware Design Competition 2021.09-2022.02           
Team up with 2 other fellow students to participate in the competition to solve problems of theoretical knowledge, circuit design, and embedded (MCU) system programming, using STC51 single chip.


### Participated in the Tengfei Cup and National Semi-final of “Suzhou Cup” 2020.09-2022.04, 2022.04-2022.08
   **Two third class prizes in the Tengfei Cup, one bronze award and one gold award in the Entrepreneurship Track**              
    * Respectively for Internet + medical, smart wearable devices, urban community improvement, lithium battery recycling             
    * Mainly responsible for the writing of the business plan, which is related to accounting (My Second Major). Use many businesses model including SWOT, Porter's five forces model, etc., and I carry out risk control at the same time.
   **Outstanding Creative Award in the National Semi-final of “Suzhou Cup”**             
    * The ‘lithium battery recycling Programme’ participated in ‘Suzhou Youth Elite Entrepreneurship Competition’, we entered the national semi-finals and won the Outstanding Creative Award.

### The Mathematical Modeling Competition Award 2021.11-2022.03, 2022.08-2022.09, 2023.02-On Going   
   **The H Award in Mathematical Contest in Modeling/ The Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM)**      
    * Aiming at the evaluation and optimization of port traffic capacity, we used graph theory and other methods including hierarchical clustering to model port capacity. Constructed a hybrid optimization plan for ports and give the port a boost in utility.          
   **Provincial First Prize of China National Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling**          
    * We established a micro-variable positioning model based on alternating flicker from the perspective of pure orientation passive positioning and a batch-based UAV scheduling model based on deduction.           
   **Participate in 2023 Mathematical Contest in Modeling/ The Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM)**             
    * Final prize has not been released         
    * We aim to analysis of relationships between plant biodiversity and drought. We proposed our model “resistance based on difference equation and finite element simulation”, which gives a way to tell how a plant community adapts when exposed to cycles of drought over successive generations under different conditions like plant kinds, precipitation conditions and Interspecific relationships.
