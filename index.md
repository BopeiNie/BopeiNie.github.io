# Research and Engineering Practice         
### 1. Research project on multi-model feature integration and image generation 2023.03-On Going            
Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong Prof. Xiaojuan QI
* Currently working on baseline for image generation. I prefer to conduct multi-model feature integration on image generation, which is using language to guide image generation like Stable Diffusion, but we want to build images with more structure information.
* Also did some survey on how to conduct image understanding and 3D scene understanding with the guidance of NLP feature. Followed the process of CLIP series research on both 2D and 3D scene.


### 2. Research projects on graph neural network and graph Contrastive learning 2022.10‚ÄìOn Going
Ministry of Education Key Lab For Intelligence Networks and Network Security, XJTU Prof. Pinghui WANG
* Program is leaded by a PhD. Candidate and about Graph Neural Network with Contrastive Learning. We followed up ‚ÄúPrototypical Graph Contrastive Learning‚Äù and made our own contributions.
* ‚ÄúPrototypical Graph Contrastive Learning‚Äù show a way to introduce contrastive learning into graph filed form image filed, which includes ‚ÄúGraph augmentation‚Äù, ‚ÄúContrastive learning‚Äù, ‚Äúlearn form protocol processing‚Äù. Base on this framework, we introduced more global information from using contrastive learning on protocol and using Curriculum Learning. We also improve the efficiency of the code with the newly published framework ‚ÄúSimple Unsupervised Graph Representation Learning‚Äù. In addition, we use mask to improve the acc and robotic of the final model. After that, we did transferring learning.
* Acc reach up to about 94% on unsupervised learning, and acc on transferring learning raise about 5% from baseline.
* Follow-up finishing work is underway, once finished, the research will be submitted to a top publisher.


### 3. Unmanned aerial vehicles related programme 2022.03-2022.09
School of Automation Science and Engineering, XJTU Engineer Yuan LIU
#### 1) Participated in the debugging and experiment of quadrotor UAV
* Mainly responsible for using the OpenMv module to use the visual solution to address and plan the target location or route, and responsible for the assembly and debugging of the quadrotor UAV.
#### 2) Publishment ‚ÄúUAV swarm positioning and scheduling method from the perspective of pure orientation passive positioning‚Äù
* We discusses the positioning and swarm formation scheduling of UAVs based only on azimuth information.
* Three issues were discussed: the minimum number of signal source UAV sorties when a single UAV is positioned; how the UAV can determine its own position under the guidance of three known-location signal source UAVs; How to carry out large-scale inter-UAV position sharing between each other and batch scheduling while maintaining the number of signals source UAVs is the lowest number.
* The paper is published on ‚Äú2023 IEEE 6th Information Technology, Networking, Electronic and Automation Control Conference‚Äù, which is Retrieved by EI. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10082189


### 3. Stock Portfolio Design Based on Machine Learning and Optimization Scheme 2022.04-2022.06
Institute of Systems Engineering, XJTU Prof. Hongxing YE
* Of SSE 50 in the secondary market , our team used Monte Carlo simulation, minimum cost flow, LSTM and DP knapsack problem to simulate and analyze it, and finally obtained the weight distribution result, and the profit and loss were controlled at a thousand points Between one and five thousandths.
* We divides the determination of the investment portfolio into three stages: the first stage is to determine the stocks, using the classic Markowitz model to select ten high-quality stocks from the top 50 in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The second stage determines the weights, and uses the dynamic programming of the complete knapsack problem to solve the stock weight allocation. In the third stage, risk is measured, and long-term and short-term neural networks are used to predict stock prices and predict risk participation in decision-making.
* We final got a gain from 1/1000 to 5/1000 and did not lose any money for over 30 days


### 4. Leadership in winter and summer social practical research 2020.11-2021.03, 2021.06-2021.09
#### 1) The survey on SEL children's social emotions and the Internet plus medical research in Xiejiasi Village in 2021.
School of economics and finance of Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University Prof. Lihua WANG
* We used basic research and data processing methods including questionnaire production and questionnaire analysis, Interviews and interpersonal communication
* Mastered data analysis software SPSS, including software implementation of statistical methods such as correlation analysis, trustworthiness analysis, chi-square test, etc.

#### 2) The carbon price prediction based on the Radial basis neural networks
School of economics and finance of Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University Prof. Chunyan ZHAO
* Discuss and analyze the radial basis function neural network model, combine previous research experience, conduct group research and discussion, and systematically and comprehensively analyze the feasibility of the radial basis function neural network model carbon price prediction system in the current carbon trading market.
